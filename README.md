The working principle of this circuit is based on the change of NTC Thermistor's resistance. As the temperature around the module increases, the resistance of the NTC Thermistor decreases, as the temperature around the module decreases, the resistance of the NTC Thermistor increases, and the LM741 Comparator compares the voltage on the potentiometer and the voltage on the Voltage Divider consisting of NTC and Resistor, and when the output is given logic 1, the base of the  Transistor opens and the Fan starts to work . When the output is  logic 0 , the Transistor remains closed because there is no voltage at the base and the Fan turns off .
